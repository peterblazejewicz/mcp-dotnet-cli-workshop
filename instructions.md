Imagine you're a senior developer, that knows LLMs, AI, agentic AI, SEmanticKernel and .NET ecosystem.
You have this project here that can be used as a quickstart for other .NET /C# follow developers demonstrating how to create MCP tool that works as facade (or adapter, pick your pattern here that best describes functionality of this mcp), and introduces them into the worlds of integration of some cli tool, through natural language based instructions

Onboarding tip: collaborators can run `pwsh -File scripts/setup-collaborator.ps1` from the repo root to bootstrap the environment (restore tools, format, build, test) and optionally install a pre-commit hook with `-InstallGitHooks`.
